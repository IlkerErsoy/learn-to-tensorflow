# Getting Started Lessons

The objective of these lessons are to gently introduce some core concepts and basic usage of Tensorflow.  There are several common misunderstandings that hold independent learners back, such as the difference between the Tensorflow code and the Tensorflow graph, which can take weeks or months to figure out and can be very fustrating to learn on ones own.

The following concepts will be explored:

- executing the *Code* vs the *Graph*
- reversing the *Graph*
- a definition of *Model*, *Learning Rate*, and *Loss*
- a better way to structure code


## Lesson 0 - A review

- Use python to calculate a x b = c

## Lesson 1 - Just make something happen

- Make something super simple
- Address #1 mental hurdle right away
- 'a' isn't equal to 5, 'b' isn't equal to 7 !
- Code the *graph* then run the *graph*

## Lesson 2 - Same thing but a little better

- placeholder instead of constants
- reuse the same *graph*

## Lesson 3 - Same thing but a little better

- Variable vs Constant vs Placeholder
- Change variable

## Lesson 4 - In Reverse

- Tensorflow is used to *learn*
- for *ab = c*, what if we know *b* and *c*?
- use Tensorflow to estimate *a*
- what happens if the learning rate is too high or too low?

## Lesson 5 - Estimation

- Estimate an imperfect line *y = ax + b* given *y* and *x*.
- *y = ax + b* is called our *model*

## Lesson 6 - Same thing but a lot better

- Use the matrix

## Lesson 7 - Same thing with a curve

- *y = ax^2 + bx + c*

## Lesson 8 - Be a good programmer

- move model to its own file
- move data to its own file
- for bonus points we graph

## Lesson 9 - Beyond Linear

- Most problems are not linear
- First multi-layered neural net
