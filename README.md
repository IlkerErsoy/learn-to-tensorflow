# Learn To Tensorflow

Updated for Tensorflow 1.14

This repository contains mini programming challenges
aimed to gradually stretch your working skills and 
understanding of tensorflow basics.

If you are totally new to Tensorflow and don't know the 
difference between the graph and code, check out the subdirectory [the_basics](the_basics)

For daily exercises that will build your coding skills 
through repetition and elaboration check out [daily_exercise](daily_exercise)


## The code uses Python 3.7+

Install Python 3.7+ if you don't have it already.  On mac use `brew install python3.7` for 3.7

Create a virtual env and install the dependencies
```
virtualenv --python python3.7 ~/env/learn-to-tensorflow
source ~/env/learn-to-tensorflow/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
On future sessions just use
```
source ~/env/learn-to-tensorflow/bin/activate
```
